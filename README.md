# Crystal Collector!

Crystal Collector is a javascript game where the user is presented with 4 crystals that have a random number value of 1-12 assigned to them and by clicking them they must reach the target number that is also chosen at random. Once the user is able to add up the numbers to match the target number they win. If they go over the target number they lose.
